# Three.js Solar System (React + GSAP + Vite)

An interactive 3D Solar System simulation built with React, Three.js, and GSAP.
The project renders the Sun, planets, and background stars in a dynamic scene powered by WebGL.

You can run it locally with Node.js or inside a Docker container.

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
